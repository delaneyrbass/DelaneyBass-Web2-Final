     <h1>DONATE TO PHILLY ART COLLECTIVE GALLERY</h1>
     <img src="img/donate/gallery.png" alt="gallery">
     <p>The Coronavirus, COVID-19, is killing the Philly Art Collective Gallery! Over the years Philly Art Collective has become a part of the Philly arts family, and has harvested a great love for underrepresented artists.  We need your help to save this pivotal art gallery. After 6 strong years of serving artists from PA, NJ, NY, and the DMV, the Philly Art Collective Gallery may be seeing its final days!  Closed by restrictions of COVID, unable to do our lively pop-up art experiences, we have struggled to keep our space alive. We have applied unsuccessfully for government assistance and a variety of art grants. We are hopeful for the future but, exhausted. So now we are asking for your help on behalf of all our artists.  
        <br>This beautiful gallery is located in the heart of Old City, Philly, an area well known for the arts in all genres. We are a collective gallery, that puts on amazing events such as HERspace Womenâ€™s Art Festival, Old City Has Jazz, Glow in the Dark Night, The BIG Exhibit and outstanding performances by local artists. 
        <br> bulk of our income comes from various donation based pop-ups, normally held on each weekend. The love that we have for the arts in Philadelphia will never die and we hope that with your support, PACG will survive these crucial times to get back to our mission of serving the locals. 
        <br>Take a few seconds to donate and share what you can. No donation is too small and all donations and support is highly appreciated.</p>
